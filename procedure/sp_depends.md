# sp_depends

In Microsoft SQL Server, the `sp_depends` system stored procedure is used to find dependencies between database objects. It helps identify the objects that depend on a specified object, or the objects on which the specified object depends. Dependencies can include relationships such as views depending on tables, stored procedures depending on tables or views, and so on.

Here is a brief overview of the use of `sp_depends`:

1. **Finding Dependencies on a Specific Object:**
   You can use `sp_depends` to find objects that depend on a specific object. For example, to find objects that depend on a table named `MyTable`, you would execute:

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_depends 'MyTable';
   ```

   This will return a list of objects that depend on `MyTable`, such as `views`, `stored procedures`, or `triggers`.

2. **Finding Objects on which a Specific Object Depends:**
   You can use `sp_depends` to find objects on which a specific object depends. For example, to find objects on which a stored procedure named `MyStoredProcedure` depends, you would execute:

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_depends 'MyStoredProcedure';
   ```

   This will return a list of objects that `MyStoredProcedure` depends on, such as tables or views.

3. **Checking Object Dependencies Automatically:**
   SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) also uses the information provided by `sp_depends` when you use the "View Dependencies" feature in SSMS. This feature allows you to explore the dependencies graphically for a specific object.

It's important to note that `sp_depends` has some limitations and may not always provide complete or accurate dependency information, especially in complex scenarios. Additionally, starting with SQL Server 2005 and later versions, the `sys.dm_sql_referencing_entities` and `sys.dm_sql_referenced_entities` dynamic management views are recommended for more accurate and comprehensive dependency information.

For example, you can use the following query to find objects referencing a specific table:

```sql
SELECT referencing_schema_name, referencing_entity_name
FROM sys.dm_sql_referencing_entities('dbo.MyTable', 'OBJECT');
```

While `sp_depends` can still be useful, especially in older versions of SQL Server, it's a good practice to be aware of the more modern alternatives available in newer versions of SQL Server.
