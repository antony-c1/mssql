# sp_columns.md

The `sp_columns` system stored procedure in SQL Server is used to retrieve information about the columns of a table or view, including column names, data types, lengths, precision, scale, and other related properties. It can be particularly useful when you need detailed information about the structure of a specific table or view.

Here's a basic example of how to use `sp_columns`:

```sql
-- To get information about columns of a table
EXEC sp_columns 'YourTableName';
```

Replace 'YourTableName' with the name of the table for which you want to retrieve column information.

This stored procedure returns result sets containing details about the columns in the specified table, making it easier to understand the schema and properties of the database object.
